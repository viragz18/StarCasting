	<h2>JB Shorts 16: Different Venue, Same Quality</h2>
	<p>The night began with ‘Magaluf‘, written by Sarah McDonald Hughes, in which we were taken on a farcical journey with Chloe (Amy Lythgoe) and Sinead (Hollie-Jay-Bowes) on their stereotypical teen holiday. I was constantly reminded of a two-handed, modern day ‘Bouncers and Shakers’ due to the non-stop laughs and fast pace of the piece.  A well directed, wonderful piece of theatre and a brilliant choice to open the show.</p>
<p>Second on, and the first of two classics of British literature broken down in to fifteen minutes of pure entertainment, was ‘Toil and Trouble‘ written by Trevor Suthers. A truly original take on the story of a certain Scottish King who for our own sakes is named ‘MacMeth’ (Peter Ash). Three terrifyingly hilarious ‘hags’ steal the stage for fifteen minutes in the forms of ‘Mammy’, ‘Granny’ and ‘Fanny’ (Maria O’Hare, Jenny Gregson and Jennifer Bray). Constant cleverly written filth throughout and an energy on the stage that clearly stemmed from the great direction of Sue Jenkins meant there was no respite for the aching jaws of the audience.</p>
<p>Guiding us into the interval was ‘In My Shoes‘ written by Dave Simpson. You’d be forgiven for wondering how on Earth they could keep up the same levels in every performance, surely there will be a slower paced piece at some point? Not this one! Alyx Tole’s creative direction earned the first standing ovation of the evening with a superbly done Freaky Friday style’ body swap. Peter and Carol (Murray Taylor and Judy Holt) swap not only their entire outfits on stage but even manage to swap hair; the beautifully, and comically, executed set piece together with great use of music kept me tittering throughout the break.</p>
<p>Moving in to the second Act with ‘A Grand Malaise and a Small Cappuccino‘ written by Justin Moorhouse. I felt this portion of the evening had a much needed serious edge. Not that it wasn’t very cleverly written and kept each of us chuckling throughout, which it did, but the subject matter was that of benefit thieves. The serious issue was mirrored by the more realistic character of Angela (Rosina Carbone). However, with clever direction from Rupert Hill and a very entertaining performance from Lee Toomes, as ‘Martin’, the audience was treated to laughter but also were also given a stimulating reminder of the moral difficulties that be fall your every day social worker.</p>
<p>The penultimate display ‘Rebrand‘ came to us from the established mind of another JB veteran, James Quinn, however this time in  collaboration with Aileen Quinn. The two writers find a way to provoke independent thought about a very serious topic, War, whilst still engaging the audience and keeping with the tone of the night. When Geoff (Toby Hadoke), Stephanie (Danielle Henry) and Emma (Amy Gavin) debate how they can rebrand to make War popular among the public again, as in the good old days, what could the answer be? Team GB to the rescue… right? Exceedingly accomplished performances all round, with direction to match: a classic JB piece.</p>
<p>How to finish off an evening of this magnitude and keep with the pace, comedy and quality of the night? Enter JB legends Peter Kerry and Lindsay Williams joined by direction from the talented Joyce Branagh and their mind-blowing ‘Wuthering Heights at Hurricane Speed by Emily Bronte‘. The title says everything that need be said about content however mere words can’t describe exactly what happened during that ‘precise’ fifteen minutes. An incredible pace throughout kept up by this four person cast of Verity Henry, Amy Drake, Richard Weston and, the star of the show for me, Robin Simpson. Each cast member took on countless different roles, sometimes switching on stage, in a breathtaking, Brechtian style performance that capped a top quality evening.</p>
<p>JB Shorts, you’ve done it again!</p>
<p>Thank you Dave, Diane and James</p>



<h2>5 Questions in 5 Minutes with Casting Director Kirsty McGregor</h2>
<p>Success in any industry is challenging yet when your chosen vocation consists of an enterprise built entirely on the lucrative world of entertainment, ones obstacles exist in another stratosphere. Throw in the scarcity of Australian show business and you have yourself an audacious professional recipe.</p>
<p>Casting director Kirsty McGregor is the crème de le crème of the Australian film and television industry. Originally an actress, in 2001 her passion for talent ignited the birth of McGregor Casting in her modest one bedroom flat in Sydney’s Woolloomooloo. One year later Kirsty’s strong work ethic was reaping the awards and she opened her office in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore. Fast forward 14 years, 68 TV and Film credits, a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, a Casting Guild Australia (CGA) Award winner and two time nominee for the Casting Society of America Awards, Kirsty now runs her business from a deluxe warehouse space in the chic suburb of Redfern – home to McGregor Casting since 2011.</p>
<p>With the grander space came the larger projects and Kirsty has been appointed local casting director for Thor:Ragnarok currently filming in Queensland, Australia and Mary Magdalene directed by Garth Davis starring Joaquin Phoenix. McGregor first worked with Davis as lead casting director on his first feature film Lion. Starring Nicole Kidman the film received glowing reviews at its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016 and is due for a USA release on November 25, 2016.</p>
<p>The dynamic team now comprises of 6 key players, including Ollie, the majestic Cocker Spaniel, aka the resident “Casting Dog” and Kirsty’s determination has undoubtedly established McGregor Casting as a prominent fixture in the daily lives of local and international acting agents.lion

With nominations in 7 categories including Best Casting for a Feature Film, Best Casting for a TV Commercial, Best Casting for a Short Film, two nominations for Best Casting in a Telemovie, Best Casting in a TV Comedy and Best Casting in a TV Drama it is evident Kirsty McGregor and her troupe have sealed their place as Australia’s go-to Casting Agency.</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone here at Casting Networks Australia we would like to congratulate McGregor Casting and wish Kirsty and her crew the best of luck at the awards.
Alixandra: As a young actress why did you decide to take the leap from performing to casting?</p>
<p>Kirsty McGregor: I worked a decent amount for a young actor. I was very fortunate to work on some great projects and for some amazing companies and networks. But I realised that … there’s no guarantee of ‘working your way up’. I had actor friends who were AMAZING, the best in the biz and selling wine in their 40’s between gigs. I just decided that whilst I loved the industry I wanted to find something for myself which didn’t depend so much on my exact age at any given time and what I looked like. I greatly admire actors who have the determination and passion to stick it through rejection – I just wanted something more stable for myself.</p>
<p>A: Starting your own business certainly has its challenges. What are some of the obstacles you faced in the early days of your start-up?</p>
<p>KM: I was very fortunate to have some wonderful clients early on and friends who held my hand and gave me advice – like the wonderful Antonia Murphy at Fountainhead Casting. She encouraged me and made me believe I could go it alone. But we still face obstacles! And I still face rejection! Casting is still a very freelance job, like acting – there are still jobs we would LOVE to do that naturally go to other people. I think one of the greatest constant worries is employing people. We are a business, but still work from job to job. It could dry up at any time! You worry as much about your employees and making sure you can pay them as you do about yourself.</p>
<p>A: Describe a typical day in the McGregor Casting office?</p>
<p>KM: Can’t – sorry! It varies so much from day to day. And we like to retain some mystery.</p>
<p>A: What is some advice you can give actors on scoring a role and staying pro-active?</p>
<p>KM: Try not to think of it as scoring a role! Think of the audition as the job, not something you need to ‘get through’. If you can come in, with something to offer… come in and PLAY the role, don’t try and get the role…. It’s a very powerful, positive and refreshing way to approach an audition.</p>
<p>A: You have a number of exciting projects which you have been signed to including Thor:Ragnarok and Mary Magdalene. How important is it for actors to have complete profiles on Casting Networks in order for them to maximise their chances of landing an audition?</p>
<p>KM: We use Casting Networks every hour of every day. I cannot express how important a tool it is for us. We brief on it, we book sessions via it and we send every casting session to directors on it! Not only is it important for an actor be on the site, it is important to keep your CV and headshot UP TO DATE. We send a link to every director, they see ALL your information. What is the point of spending money on a new headshot (for example) and then not updating it so that directors will actually see it?</p>
